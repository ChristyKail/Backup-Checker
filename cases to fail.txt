Cases to check for:
- Wrong roll has been backed up, or roll has been missed when backing up
	- file and source index will not be in backup index
- Source file has been deleted or moved prior to backing up
	- source index will not be in file list or backup index
- Files didn't have source MHLs made for them (such as mezz files, or files that have been drag and dropped)
	- file will not be in source index



checks to write:

- Source index vs backup index - check if any source indexes are missing from the backup index
- Source files vs backup index - check if any existing files are missing from the backup index

- Source files integrity - check if any source indexes are missing from the source files
- Source index integrity - check if any files are missing from the source index




TODO STUFF

Skip hidden files, but also log them
Report if any requested source folders were Skipped
Allow different source folders to be scanned
Be more flexible about where to trim LTO file structure
